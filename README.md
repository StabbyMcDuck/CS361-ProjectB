Project B: Grocery Shopper Price Chopper!  A mobile-friendly site that compares prices at 2+ stores and tells you which store to buy your cheaper items at!

To visit this site go to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~imhoffr/CS361-ProjectB-master/

You will need to create a new user account if you don't have one already. After logging in you can create a new shopping list and select the item you want to purchase from the list. You can choose the comparison to show you stores in all the cities in the database, or you can select only the city you are concerned with. Once the list is created it will show you the prices for each item at different stores in the selected city and highlight the store with the lowest total price for you. If a particular item is unavailable at a store the table will display the price as N/A.

You can also click the "Add Grocery Items & Prices" link on the top right to enter the prices for items you have purchased at a store to update or add prices to the database. This will update the price in the system for the respective items so that other users can use this data to help them decide where to shop.
